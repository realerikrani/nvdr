It is assumed that R is [downloaded and installed](https://www.r-project.org/) on a UNIX platform, Windows or MacOS. In the case of Ubuntu or other Linux systems, sometimes other programs such as libcurl4-openssl-dev and libxml2-dev need to be installed as well (then the error messages mention missing "curl" or "xml2-config").
Eventually, the installation instructions can be followed from the R console.

## Installation

Install *nvdr* from GitHub.
```{r gh-installation, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("realerikrani/nvdr")
```
